Progress Report 1 (08/31/2020):
- For the Git assignment, I've managed to create a GitHub repository for this class, CSE 4050, by watching a couple of videos about Git. I've learned different commands on Git that will help me throughout the semester so that I can push or pull any assignments from my GitHub repository. I've learned new commands like "git checkout, git revert, git reset, git status, and git log". 
- For the HTML and CSS assignment, I've managed to also finish it by creating my personal website from scratch using the HTML and CSS programming language. For this assignment, I watched a lot of videos about HTML and CSS because I only know little about them. I learned many things like HTML tags and CSS rules/rule sets. The videos helped me a lot so that I can start these assignments and understand how to proceed correctly. 


Progress Report 2 (09/14/2020):
- For this progress report, I changed my plan of using my personal website as my web app. Instead, I created a new website that will implement new ideas that I have for a web app. On this website, I made a list of videogames and their platforms. In here, two text fields and an add button can be used by the user so he/she can add a videogame title and its platform. 
- For the assignments, I managed to complete the Firebase Hosting and Cloud Firestore part by creating a web app that is hosted by Firebase and stores the data into Firestore. Here is the web app link that I've been working on: https://cse-4050-webapp.web.app/
- For the Javascript and JSON assignments, I implemented them on this web app but I still need to learn more about those two progamming languages so I can implement more functions for my web app.

Progress Report 3 (09/28/2020):
- For this progress report, I managed to create a simple runnable HTML program or Web page script element that illustrates the use of JSON.parse and JSON.stringify.
- For my Web app, there are no major changes except adding a logo. I am still learning on how to figure out the Firebase Authentication part and making my Web app more appealing.

Progress Report 4 (10/12/2020):
- For this progress report, I've made minimal changes on my web app by implementing a 'NavBar' and placing a "Login" and "Sign up" button on my HTML document so that I can modify these buttons for the Firebase authentication assignment. I am still learning on how to create modal forms so I can link them to the Firebase Authentication service. Also, I am still conceptualizing on how I will structure my web app or some additional things I will add/modify.

Progress Report 5 (10/26/2020):
- For this progress report, I've created a whole new Web App for the past two weeks with the help of several online resources. I think I've managed to implement and finish the Firebase Authentication assignment where the user can Log in and Sign up on my Web App. Also, this new Web App has the same features and ideas on my previous Web App but there are key differences on each one. Furthermore, this Web App implements Materialize CSS in which I've learned a bit in this past couple of weeks. I still need to fix a lot of things on this new Web App like updating and deleting some of the data stored by the users.

Progress Report 1:
- For the Git assignment, I've managed to create a GitHub repository for this class, CSE 4050, by watching a couple of videos about Git. I've learned different commands on Git that will help me throughout the semester so that I can push or pull any assignments from my GitHub repository. I've learned new commands like "git checkout, git revert, git reset, git status, and git log". 
- For the HTML and CSS assignment, I've managed to also finish it by creating my personal website from scratch using the HTML and CSS programming language. For this assignment, I watched a lot of videos about HTML and CSS because I only know little about them. I learned many things like HTML tags and CSS rules/rule sets. The videos helped me a lot so that I can start these assignments and understand how to proceed correctly.

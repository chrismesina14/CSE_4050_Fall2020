        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Christian Philip Mesina. I was born and raised in the Philippines. My family and I moved here in the US when I was 14 years old. I am a Computer Science transfer student at California State University-San Bernardino.
          I am currently on my senior year and will graduate on December 2020. After I got my three Associate's Degree from Victor Valley College. I transferred to CSUSB to get my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
          My hobbies are playing video games (PC, PS4, Mobile) and basketball. My favorite video game ever would be The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Currently, I am playing a lot of Monster Hunter World, Destiny 2, and Call of Duty Modern Warfare. You can find some of my gaming clips on my YouTube channel linked on my 'Contact' section. 
          My favorite basketball team is the Miami Heat. One day, my dream is to help create a medical nanotechnology that will help cure cancer. For now, I am working hard to fulfill my dreams for myself and my family, and also to become a better Software Engineer.</p>

        <h2>About this Website</h2>
        <p>This website is an on-going personal project that is built on HTML and CSS. 
          For the 'Resume' section, I used an HTML template found online which implements some JavaScript code for its animations and some features. I edited some of the template's design so that it can fit in to my personal style and preference.
          For the 'Contact' section, I used a Linktree account so that you can find all my social media and professional account information there. 
          For my 'Portfolio' section, I am still in the process of creating and brainstorming the ideas for that page. 
          For my 'Extras' section, I am still debating on putting a gaming page on that link where I post my achievements and progress on some the games that I currently play.
          This website is hosted through AWS services such as S3 storage, Route 53, and CloudFront.  
          I plan on implementing a database management system using AWS for my feedback section so that I can record all the responses of the user. 
          But for now, since I have zero knowledge on how to use the AWS database services, I will leave that section as a future project. 
          Also, I plan on improving this website's capabilities more by implementing JavaScript functions so that I can put more new design, animations, and features.
